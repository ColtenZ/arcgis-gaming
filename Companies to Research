Hey bud, hope the movie was great last night! As promised, here are a few companies that are already conducting analysis operations in the esports space.

Mobalytics

Rift Analyst (by a company called Fluendo)

Esports One

Shadow.GG

LOL Sumo

These companies are a mix of video capture and analytics to improve your game. So far I haven't heard of any GIS focused company out there, so the field is wide open!
